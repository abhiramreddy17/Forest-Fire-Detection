In an era where environmental sustainability is integral to everyday life, forest fire pose a significant threat. Early detection is crucial for effective fire suppression and minimization of damages. Traditional fire detection methods often fall short in keeping pace with the rapid spread of fires, highlighting the need for more dynamic and accessible detection tools. The Forest Fire Detection Using Computer Vision (CV) project addresses this challenge by integrating advanced fire detection capabilities into an aerial imaging system, leveraging the comprehensive resources of CV techniques. The proposed approach leverages advanced image processing and feature extraction techniques to identify fire-affected areas. The system utilizes color segmentation, texture analysis, and object recognition to detect fire patterns in aerial images. The approach is robust to varying environmental conditions and can detect fires in early stages.

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving an accuracy of 95 percent in detecting forest fires. The system’s efficiency and reliability make it a valuable tool for environmental monitoring and disaster response. This project demonstrates the potential of CV for forest fire detection, offering a promising solution for early warning systems. Future work includes integrating CV with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for real-time fire detection and monitoring, enabling swift response and enhanced situational awareness. The system sends real-time alerts to authorities via G-mail when a forest fire is detected. The system employs a combination of color-based and motion-based detection algorithms to identify potential fire regions and uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send emails to pre-configured G- mail accounts. The system provides an effective and efficient way to detect forest fires and alert authorities to take prompt action, minimizing damage and preventing the spread of forest fire.
